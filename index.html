    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I may look like a quiet guy, but trust me, I’ve got big dreams—like turning a mafia organization into a community service project. I’m passionate about justice, personal growth, and occasionally punching existential threats with a golden fist. Life is my canvas, and I’m not afraid to use my Stand to add a little… flair.
